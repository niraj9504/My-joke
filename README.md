# My-joke
It's an chrome extension which gives random jokes each time.

Process to use extension on your browser:-
1. clone the whole file in your desktop.(type git clone url)
2. open chrome web-browser and go to :- chrome://extensions/
3. select devloper mode and tap on load unpacked.
4. select the cloned folder and pin it on the top left corner.
5. For each time on clicking it, you will get a random joke.

Thank you !
